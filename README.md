Chat app with firebase

This Chat app has these features:
- Register / Login
- Can contain attachments (Photo, video)
- Messages are sectioned day by day
- Messages should have sent, seen indicators (ticks)
- Text box must extend if the input is long
- Overall smooth scrolling experience
- Support Offline send ( work best with text message, video and image not support offline display yet)

NOTE: 
- You can register your own account for testing
- Please do a "pod install" if build fail
- I'm using free firebase account so there might be some slow and limit experiences.
- There are some missing features and it's not complet yet.

THANKS FOR SPENDING YOUR TIME.

AU NGUYEN.
